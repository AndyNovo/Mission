# Massively improve millions of lives

This requires integrity, influence, technology, vision, strength, and great energy.

I live, every day, in accordance with sound values and lasting principles.  They guide me and maximize my efforts.

The roles of my life which support this mission are:

### Family Man

My family, when taken care of daily, is a source of strength, resilience, joy, and legacy.  

### Individual

My daily cultivation of healthy habits creates harmony, restoration, energy, and inspiration.  
This role is the source of my integrity which influences all aspects of my life.

### Mentor

By training the leaders of the next generation I help unlock massive value in their lives and the lives of those they guide in the future.
This helps me stay on top of trends and to accomplish more than what my efforts alone can accomplish.

### Businessman 

By nurturing services and products that meet real needs and scale well 
I help to reach millions, create economic value, and practice my ability to visualize and enact positive outcomes.

## Principles and Values That I Believe

These principles are natural laws of this society.  To break them is to invite unwanted outcomes, to act in harmony with them leads to positive outcomes.  

* I can choose my reactions which is far more important than what happens to me.

* Rewards are in proportion to the amount of service rendered.

* Positive outcomes in life follow the patterns of a harvest.  There aren't shortcuts and 
you have to cultivate and nurture the roots for a long time before seeing the fruits of your labors.

* Begin with the end in mind.  Creation starts first in the mind.

* Put first things first.  To do the most important thing each day is the key to avoiding a life of quiet desperation.

* Concentrate your thoughts on the things you can control not on the things outside of your control.

* When dealing with others FIRST do everything you can to help them feel understood THEN, if still relevant, help them understand you.

* The key to living well is a healthy self-image.

* You must take good care of yourself in order to take good care of those around you.

* Balance your efforts between producing and increasing your ability to produce.

* Give effort to reflecting on and deciding if you are doing the right things. (Leadership and Management are both important.)

* Learn to see abundance everywhere.  Conflict emerges from a scarcity-driven way of thinking.

* Maturity is the balance between courage and consideration.

* You cannot be efficient with people.  People take effectiveness.

* Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.

* Aim to be proud of your efforts at the end of each day.

* There will always be obstacles.  Grit allows you to see them as exciting challenges to overcome and not as an excuse to quit.

* The height of the building is proportional to the depth and strength of the foundation.

* 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts.

* Stress comes in two flavors, distress and eustress.  Eustress is healthy.

* Cultivate an attitude which is grateful and expectant.

* To nurture greatness in others you must foster the ability to see greatness in them.

* "Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."

* Integrity is honoring the commitments I make to myself; to subordinate moods to values.

* When dealing with others you have to honor mutual benefit and voluntary exchange.  This works best when both parties have healthy self-images.
